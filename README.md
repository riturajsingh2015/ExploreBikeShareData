# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Udacity Data Analyst Degree

## Overview
In this project, I will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I will write a code import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing <b>descriptive statistics</b>. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
